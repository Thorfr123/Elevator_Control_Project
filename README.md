# Elevator Control Project
Project developed in the course of Power Systems and Control (SCP) in the 1st Semester of the 1st Year of the Master in Electrical and Computer Engineering (MEEC) from the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP).\
The project consists in controlling the position of an elevator, through a FOC vector control of a PMSM. In addition, the project also features a braking system for the DC bus.\
Project files are available for PSIM versions 2020a and 2021b.
